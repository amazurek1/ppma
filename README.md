# Repo Summary
This code is designed to compute the features outlined in the methods section of the research paper, "Predicting the Purity of Multispecific Antibodies from Sequence Using Machine Learning". It includes a step-by-step guide on how to transform the raw data into features suitable for a Machine Learning model.

The dataset, "example_data.csv", contains two sample antibodies and the code along first walks you through how you transform the sequence into overall amino acid percentages, and how we featurized the format and germlines.The Kabat data are also data corresponding to the same antibodies in the example data, and show how we feature engineered from individual framework and CDR components
